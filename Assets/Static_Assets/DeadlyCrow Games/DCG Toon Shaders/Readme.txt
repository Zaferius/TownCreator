Thanks for bought my asset :) !

Well, the use of this shader is pretty straight forward,

The custom lighting shader works with a ramp texture from left to right, shadows are in the left and highlights on the right, you get the idea, so now you can create your own ramps :), can't wait to see them!

**IMPORTANT**
- If the outline on your models looks weird, or broken, its because of the normals, the outline works using the vertex normals to extrapolate the direction of the outline. To fix this i recommend to use smoothed normals in the import settings, and normal map to correct the mesh look (if it has hard edges).
- The Cutout Shader is a WIP and it may be changed in the future, because, the outline technique is not compatible with the transparency cut made in this kind of shaders, that, said, the illusion of outline is created by using the alpha of the diffuse map, and the alpha should be like a gradient, if it is a sharp-edge alpha map the outline effect won't be visible, or it may have artifacts.
